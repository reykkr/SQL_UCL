Aviation Database Schema for Aircraft

This database schema represents an aviation management system that stores information about aircraft, aircraft types, pilots, and flights. The schema includes tables for aircraft, types of aircraft, pilots, and flight details. The 'avion' table contains data on individual aircraft, including their registration numbers, types, capacities, range of operation, purchase dates, revision dates, and manufacturers. The 'Type' table stores information about aircraft types, with details such as manufacturer, capacity, and range. The 'pilote' table holds data about pilots, including employee numbers, names, addresses, salaries, and qualifications which reference the 'Type' table. Lastly, the 'vol' table contains information about flights, including flight numbers, schedules, routes, passenger counts, assigned aircraft types, and associated pilot employee numbers. The schema enables the efficient management of aviation-related data for tracking aircraft, their types, pilot qualifications, and flight details.
