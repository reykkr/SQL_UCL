Membership, Activities, and Sessions Database

This SQL code defines a database schema for managing membership information, various activities, and their corresponding sessions. The schema includes three main tables: "Adherent," "Activite," and "Seance." The "Adherent" table stores information about members, including an auto-incrementing ID, name, address, and age. The "Activite" table holds details about different activities, such as the name of the activity, unit cost, and unit price. The "Seance" table represents individual activity sessions, linking activities and members through foreign key references. It records the activity name, member ID, session date, session time, and any additional notes. This schema provides a foundation for tracking members, activities, and sessions within an organization or club.
